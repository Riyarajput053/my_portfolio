            Hi there! I am currently enrolled in the fourth year of the Chameli
            Devi Group of Institutions' Bachelor of Technology in Computer
            Science Engineering program. I'm excited to discover new things and
            am actively honing my data science and machine learning skills. Additionally, I have
            made several web development projects with MERN stack, which has
            greatly aided in my skill-building.

              I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. During my
              studies, I gained a strong foundation in computer science concepts
              such as algorithms, data structures, and computer organization. I
              also developed my skills in programming languages such as JavaScript and
              Python and worked on various projects that allowed me to apply my
              knowledge in practical settings. My education has equipped me with
              the skills and knowledge to excel in the field of computer
              science.
